excerpt: "About Me..."

I am a Postdoc in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. My research interest is in cancer systems biology, particularly understanding the origins of cellular heterogeneity, and how it gives rise to different cellular states, cell differentiation, drug resistance, and other emergent population behaviors. 

## Current Interests and Projects:
### Tumor Heterogeneity & Cellular Identity, Metabolic Reprogramming
Cancer cells are highly heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity is manifested in many forms: cellular phenotype, fitness, metabolic states etc. Intriguingly, what makes cancer cells unique is their ability to alter their phenotype when exposed to fluctuating environments. Cancer cells often achieve this plasticity by rewiring the underlying gene regulatory networks that gives them a unique identity in the first place, alter their metabolic needs depending on the environment, and most importantly establish cell-cell communication through which they achive an optimum population behavior. Understanding how cancer cells are unique, their inherent ability to alter their phenotype, and how emergent behaviors arise will be critical in not only deciphering the early steps of tumorigenesis, but also in designing rational strategies to target them.
