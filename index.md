I am a Postdoc in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. My research interest is in cancer systems biology, particularly understanding the origins of cellular heterogeneity, and how it gives rise to different cellular states, cell differentiation, drug resistance, and other emergent population behaviors. 

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Fractional Heterogeneity in Breast Cancer
- Phenotypic Heterogeneity in Melanoma
- Nongenetic Mechanisms of Drug Resistance and Tolerance
- Systems Pharmacology and Drug combination 
- Metabolic Reprogramming and Drug-Tolerance
- Tumor Metabolism
- Cellular Identity
