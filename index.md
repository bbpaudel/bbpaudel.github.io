I am a Postdoc in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia. My research interest is in cancer systems biology, particularly understanding the origins of cellular heterogeneity, and how it gives rise to different cellular states, cell differentiation, drug resistance, and other emergent population behaviors. 

## Current Interests and Projects:
### Tumor Heterogeneity & Cellular Identity, Metabolic Reprogramming
Cancer cells are highly heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity is manifested in many forms: cellular phenotype, genome, epigenome, fitness, metabolic states etc. Intriguingly, what makes cancer cells unique is their ability to alter their phenotype when exposed to fluctuating environments. Cancer cells achieve this plasticity by rewiring the underlying gene regulatory networks that gives them a unique identity in the first place, alter their metabolic needs depending on the environment, and most importantly establish cell-cell communication through which they achive an optimum population behavior. Understanding how cancer cells are unique, their inherent ability to alter their phenotype, and how emergent behaviors arise will be critical in not only deciphering the early steps of tumorigenesis, but also in designing rational strategies to target them.

### Nongenetic Mechanisms of Drug Resistance and Tolerance
We now appreciate that seemingly homogenous cancer cells respond differently to therapies, and anti-cancer therapies only kill a fraction of tumor cells. Such phenotypes may arise from cell subpopulations having unique cell identities and often these phenotypes evolve over time both in drug-naïve and drug-perturbed conditions. Drug resistance is often thought to arise from pre-existing genetic mutations, but accumulating evidence now points to several nongenetic mechanisms that give rise to drug-tolerance and ultimately tumor relapse.

### Systems Pharmacology and Rational Drug combination 
Understanding how cancer cells respond to anti-cancer therapies will be critical in designing appropriate interventions in successful cancer therapy. Systems pharmacology requires a robust approach in quantifying drug responses, in delienating pre-existing clonal heterogeneity, in understanding varied mode of drug actions, and their interactions.
